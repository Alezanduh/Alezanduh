## Hello! üëã

I'm Alexander Marsh a junior studying Data Science and Statistics at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). My interest in data stems as a tool to quench my inquisitiveness, provide answers to the questions that constantly consume my thoughts. I adore basketball and and applying statistics allowed me to better appreciate and understand the game from an unbiased perspective. My curiosity has guided my professional interests toward Data Analytics, Machine and Deep Learning, fields that allow me to transform questions into tangible, real-world insights.

I‚Äôm currently working on NCAAB analytics project in partnership with SkillCorner, a player tracking and computer vision company, through MSAS.  

I'm proficient in the following languages:
- C++
- Java
- R (tidyverse, etc)
- Python (numpy, pandas, skilearn, pytorch)
- SQL

If you need to reach me for any reason my email is groethe@umich.edu! üòÅ

Below is references to some of my work in coding and data analytics:
